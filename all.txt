	Stealth fighters:
		Points:
			1. The first stealth-oriented plane ever made was the Lockheed Have Blue, and was made by Lockheed in 1977.
			2. It was made by the Skunk Works part of the company, and the project was headed by American aerospace engineer Kelly Johnson.
			3. The Have Blue was made to hide from radar because of how much of a devestating loss of aircraft the U.S. took in the Vietnam war due to beint detecting by radar.

	Boeing E-3 Sentry:
		Points:
			1. The Boeing E-3 Sentry was a surveillance plane made by Boeing in 1977 and was tested later that same year in Oklahoma.
			2. It was based off of the Boeing 707 due to the planes fuel efficiency, and was one of the first planes to use the AWACS design.
			3. Its AWACS design used AEW&C radar for surveillance, having one of the best radars at the time, with it still being good enough to be used even today.

	Jumbo Jets:
		Points:
			1. The Boeing 747 plane was a plane first made in 1969, with varients being made throughout the 70s, and was first built in Everett, Washington.
			2. The 747 was made for the increase in passenger air traffic in the 50s and 60s, and was designed to hold 400 passengers at once.
			3. Its 1.5x longer and wider than its predecessor, the Boeing 737, and could carry 3x more passengers.
			4. The 747 also used far larger turbofan jet turbines than any other commerical passenger plane at that time.

Involved Science:
	Stealth Fighters:
		Points:
			1. The primary idea behind stealth planes in radar concealment, where an aircraft tries to reflect or absorb radar pulses to avoid detection.
			2. Pulses are typically reflected off of a plane by its geometry, where specific setups of facets and edges optimally reflect pulses.
			3. Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) are used to absorb radar pulses that touch the surface of the plane.

	AEW&C Radars:
		Points:
			1. AEW&C radars are based off of AESA radars, which split one radar into many different smaller modules to emit multiple pulses at once.
			2. These pulses can track the movement of multiple objects at once and can even turn electronically, allowing for easing operation.
			3. All of these smaller modules comprise each radar, which are typically covered by a rotodome, or a rotating protective cover.

	Turbofan Jet Engines:
		Points:
			1. The Turbofan Jen Engines used on the Boeing 747 were special in that they were so large, but they're basic mechanics are quite standard.
			2. The Engine is comprised of an inlet, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a nozzle, and encased in metal.
			3. It works by creating a small explosion of fuel and compressed air in order to create steam from uncompressed air to power a turbine.

Effect On The World:
	Military:
		Points:
			1. The Lockheed Have Blue project paved the way for future stealth planes, like the B-21 bomber or the F35.
			2. There are approximately 202 or so stealth fighters and bombers in the U.S. Air Force's current inventory.
			3. The U.S., China, and Russia all use and make stealth planes using the technology discovered by the Have Blue team.

	Economical:
		Points:
			1. Since 1,568 Boeing 747s have been ordered in total, that means that roughly $235,100,000,000 worth of 747s have been sold in the past 50 years.
			2. A similar amount of money (~$200,000,000,000) has been spent manufactoring all of these planes.
			3. All of this money has tremendously helped the economy in Washington, since all of this revenue is helping support individual people and companies, both big and small.

	Societal:
		Points:
			1. Boeing 747s have been used by many different countries, such as, France, China, Japan, Egypt, Australia, and Brazil, connecting millions of people over its history. 
			2. In the 1970s, there was a large increase in passenger air traffic, which corelates to the new advancements in commerical aircraft, showing the impacts of the 747 and its relatives.
			3. The 747 would lead the way for many other jumbo jets in the future, such as later Boeing models, e.g. 767 and 777, as well as Airbus planes, like the Airbus A380.

Reflection:
	The late 70s were a very important time in the Aerospace industry, especially for Washington state. Withs such advancements as the first jumbo jets and stealth fighters being made in the 70s.
